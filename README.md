Jobs in Information Technology (IT) are among the fastestgrowing
all around the world including Bangladesh. Over the last few
years, there has been a significant improvement in this field in Bangladesh.
As such, we are interested to better understand jobs in IT and Telecommunication
sector in Bangladesh. To achieve this goal, we collected data
raw from professional networking websites in Bangladesh and also digitized
some data. Instead of using using human eyes, we used machine
learning techniques to learn from data. Specifically, we used K-means
clustering and PCA (Principle Component Analysis) algorithms to group
similar jobs in a way that objects in the same group are more correlated
to each other than to those in other groups. Numerical evidence are also
provided for justification.
